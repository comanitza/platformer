## Code implementation
I have programmed all the code myself after looking at the source tutorials from https://www.kaaringaming.com/tutorials. 
The code is not synchronized the code, I have intended to do so but I got bored, I am pretty got at synchronization but I am also busy and got bored :)
## Art assets
Most of the art assets that I use are from https://github.com/KaarinGaming, I have modified a few of them and I have also used some things that I have found on the internet.
